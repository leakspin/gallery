First time in 2021 to get out of my town and since Corduente! Really nice trip, a short one but as sunburnt as always.

This time, I was shooting with a Sony A6400, using both the default lense (16-50mm f3.5-5.6) and the 50mm f1.8 from Sony too. Really nice, I have to get used to the camera and learn how to go from DSLR to mirrorless.
